Week 1:

Background Material:
1. Setting up working directory
R code { 
"getwd()" - get working directory
"dir()" - list of files
"read.csv("file name")" - reads a csv file
"ls()" - list of available functions
"source("filename")" - loads in a r file that you've made
}

Graphs:
1. Principles of Analytic Graphics
  A. Show comparisons (Evidence for a hypothersis is always relative to another competing hypothesis, Always ask "Compared to what?")
  B. Show causality, mechanism, explanation, systemic structure (What is your casual framework for thinking about a question? How you believe a system operates)
  C. Show multivariate data (more than 2 variables, need to escape flatland) 
  D. Integration of Evidence (completely integrate words, numbers, images, diagrams, graphics use many modes of presentation, dont let tool drive analysis)
  E. Describe and document evidence with approp. labels, scales, sources, edc. (Should tell a complete story)
  F. Content is kind (presentations rely on quality of data)
Aircleaner - Child symptoms increase, particle matter in air decrease

2. Graphs
Use to graphs to understand data properties, find patterns, suggest modeling strategies, debug analyses, and communicate results.
Exploratory graphs (made quickly, large number made, for personal understanding, axes/legends cleaned up later, color/size for info)
1 dimensional summeries (5-number, boxplot, histogram, density plot, barplot)
R code {
      summary(data) - 5 number summary
      boxplot(data) - boxplot
      hist(data) - histogram
}
2 dimensions (overlayed/multiple 2d plots, use color/size/shape, spinning plots, actual 3-d plots)
